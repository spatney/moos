A file allocation table (FAT) is a table that an operating system
maintains on a hard disk that provides a map of the clusters 
(the basic units of logical storage on a hard disk) that a file
has been stored in. When you write a new file to a hard disk, the
file is stored in one or more clusters that are not necessarily
next to each other; they may be rather widely scattered over the
disk. A typical cluster size is 2,048 bytes, 4,096 bytes,
or 8,192 bytes. The operating system creates a FAT entry for the
new file that records where each cluster is located and their
sequential order. When you read a file, the operating system
reassembles the file from clusters and places it as an entire
file where you want to read it. For example, if this is a long
Web page, it may very well be stored on more than one cluster
on your hard disk.
